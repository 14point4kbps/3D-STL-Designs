A 3D printed Holster for the new Taser Pulse. This first Holster is for a Belt wear for right handed draw. (taserpulseholster5.stl)



Printed using ABS with .2mm layers. I also printed it in High Visibility Yellow to help distinguish it from a firearm when open carry. Probably not usable if printed in PLA. ABS will be strong and long lasting.
Designed with pressure contacts for a tight friction fit.

07/04/2016 Two new copies. Both have a newer tight fit and a 22.5 degree forward tilt. Making for a more natural quick draw. The file pulseRTtilt.stl is for right handed draw. pulseLTtilt.stl is for left handed draw.
